This was intended as just a one-off site for some friends, so it's awfully rough around the edges.

Anyway here are some notes for getting this running.

Get the python requirements using pip http://www.pip-installer.org/ like so:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Next set up a database:

mysql -e "create database ffo default character set = utf8"
mysql ffo < schema.mysql

The connection attributes are found in the db.py file and by default they connect to a database named 'ffo' on localhost using a passwordless 'root' account. Change this if you need to.

To use secure cookies properly for login you should set up a secret in the .secret file:

echo "SOMETHING SECRET -- REPLACE THIS" > .secret

Now you can go create a user, let's say replace_name/password (there's no web interface for this yet):

mysql -e "insert into users (lower_name, display_name, ff2_password) values ('replace_name', 'replace_name', md5('password'));"

Then start it up by running ./app.py which should start it serving at http://localhost:8000/

You might want to take my email address out of some of the templates, and you can muck around with the deliciousapi stuff if you want to pull in links from delicious.

To set it up on a real webserver you can run multiple instances of the app by passing a port argument (like ./app.py 8100) and then have nginx proxy to them. See http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation/overview.html#running-tornado-in-production
